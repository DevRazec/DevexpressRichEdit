# DevexpressRichEdit

The DevExpress ASP.NET Rich Text Editor (ASPxRichEdit) is a Word-inspired control that helps you create full-featured text applications with complex formatting and display capabilities. The ASPxRichEdit supports loading, saving, exporting, and conversion to and from today's most popular text-based document formats. With the Rich Text Editor, you can allow end-users to create, edit and save rich-text documents within their browser.

Our solution involves creating a document based on a file template that is populated from the database.

We then set some restrictions to prevent the end-user from making changes.

We do not need to control users or groups changes, everyone has the same permission.

We need to protect some areas of the document.
